Currently, I'm using PostgresQL and Python.
Python modules used are flask, psycopg2, dateutil, and twitter

The scraper (birdscrape.py) works, but it will get rate-limited.

Both programs need a config.py that looks like this: << EOF
# various twitter things that I don't think you actually need
consumer_key="asdf"
consumer_secret="asdfasdf"
access_token_key = "asdfasdfdasdfasdfasdf"
access_token_secret = "asdjkashfkjasdh"

dsn = {...} # standard psycopg2 database line

apppath = "/path/to/app" # for mod_wsgi stuff
EOF

I'm currently using mod_wsgi with Apache2 to serve this.
